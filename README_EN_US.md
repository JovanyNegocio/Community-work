## My interests
My interests
My main interest is knowledge sharing!
My areas of interest are infrastructure (IaaC), SRE, Automation, DevOps Culture, Data Engineering, Python, Ruby and Rust. I also love to talk about diversity, inclusion and accessibility.

## Biografy
Natalia has been working with infrastructure since 2009, today she works as `` `XXXXXXX``` at the company` `` XXXXXXX```, has extensive experience acting as SysAdmin. Former student of physics and today deepening in studying Software Engineering and Architecture.

Try to be as active as possible in the development communities and always helping open source projects, especially when they need translation.

She also mentors other black women in the career development field and I have a wonderful event called Tech && Beer.

In love with cats, pizza, beer and her husband. :D
